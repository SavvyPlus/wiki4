WPT Trading Operations : Trade Confirmation with Macquarie Bank
===============================================================



For every trade made with WPT, a number of confirmation checks need to be completed, prior to the trade going ahead.

Transaction Confirmation Letter
===============================

WPT's trading Manager will receive an email from Macquarie Bank containing a PDF attachment with the transaction reference and other transaction details. This PDF is known as the transaction confirmation letter. The following fields in the transaction confirmation letter need to be cross-checked with the summary email from Section 2.1:

*   Counterparty details
*   Receiving person/company
*   Trade date
*   Effective date
*   Termination date
*   Instrument
    *   Swap – Check the capacity (i.e. Volume in MW) and fixed price (i.e. Strike price)
    *   Cap – Check the capacity (i.e. Volume in MW), cap price (typically $300/MWh) and fixed amount (Cap premium)
*   Initial Margin and the release date (this will be found on the final page of the transaction confirmation letter)
*   Region. This relates to the Commodity Reference Price on page 2 of the transaction confirmation letter. Check that the appropriate reference node is used for the specified price. For example:
    *   Thomastown 66 kV node =\> Victoria
    *   Sydney West 330 kV node=> New South Wales
    *   Torrens Island 66 kV node=> South Australia
    *   South Pine 275 kV node=> Queensland
    *   George Town 220 kV node=> Tasmania

The PDF transaction confirmation letter should be saved in the appropriate folder in [S:\\Wholesale Power Trading\\Trades](#). The folder naming convention is "_YYMM Counterparty_", therefore if the appropriate folder does not exist, create a new folder following the naming convention.  

Confirmation Email
==================

Once all confirmations have been made, the transaction confirmation letter needs to be signed by the appropriate authorised WPT employee and emailed back to the Macquarie Bank email address as specified on the transaction confirmation letter, typically [](). The reply email does not need to say much, it just needs to include the transaction references that are being confirmed and an electronic copy of the signed transaction confirmation letter. This confirmation step needs to be actioned within 24 hours of receiving the contract.  
The electronic copy of the signed transaction confirmation letter should be saved in the appropriate folder in [S:\\Wholesale Power Trading\\Trades]().
