WPT Trading Operations : Introduction
=====================================

  
Operational Risk is the risk that a loss will occur as a result of a breakdown in human resources, processes or technology. It occurs as a result of inadequate operational policies or procedures, failure to comply with procedures, human error, fraudulent acts, and inaccurate methodologies.  
The principles for managing Operational Risk are as follows:

*   There must be regular reporting to the RCC and Board of compliance with this Policy.
*   Operational procedures for all trading-related activities must be documented, and must be current, available and used.
*   Analytical methodologies must be documented and reviewed both in their theory and in their system implementation.
*   Any operational errors must be reported to the RCC on at least a monthly basis.
*   Ensure that information/transactional systems and processes are sufficient to:
*   Enable accurate and timely settlements and settlement forecasts to occur
*   Establish and maintain an audit trail on transactions
*   Obviate fraudulent activities
*   Identify the material terms of each contract
*   There must be effective systems for information management, such as to:
*   Record all contracts with external counterparties;
*   Illustrate portfolio exposures;
*   Record market data
*   Segregation of duties between trade execution, confirmation, and settlement is to be maintained.
*   Segregation of duties between trade execution and risk management oversight is to be maintained.
*   Operational procedures for all portfolio management activities must be current, available and used.
*   All staff must:
*   be suitably trained for their role;
*   possess a job description which clearly outlines the role and its responsibilities;
*   prior to receiving authorisations, undertake training on operational procedures and the requirements of this Policy;
*   annually undertake training on the requirements of this Policy.
