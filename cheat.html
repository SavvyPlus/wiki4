<h1>Let's do this </h1>

<p>In here, you will find a repository of cheatsheets I've collected through the years to do presentations more engaging and to write better content.
We usually put some constraints in ourself by thinking if is technical doesn't have to be fun, it's quite the opposite, nobody likes to be in a presentation with excellent content and a boring presenter.</p>

						<span class="author-description">Beside probably one of your best friends <b>"Oski"</b> worked with INCSUB as a board advisor in a tech and M&A capacity, as well as founded Neuli and Cymplar. Incsub receives over 4 million visits per month and has produced or host millions of blog post around a variety of subject, internally they've created a cheat sheet, and I copied it. Neuli and Cymplar reach were mostly publications on other sites and free resources which are still today being used and replicated by thousands of people. 
              What I've learned : 
One of the most critical skills a founder must have is the capacity to prepare, present and communicate, 9 out of 10 this is by reading and writing, nobody is born with it, it's all practice hard work and sacrifice. Or have Cheatsheet :-), so let's do the second one. </span>

					Let's be honest this knowledge sharing may put ourselves out of our comfort zone, especially when we got to pick the subjects, worst off if we get a topic we don't know a lot about. FEAR not! Because the ultimate purpose of this knowledge sessions is to have fun!, it's true I promise. You see we are kinda a mixed team. Young dev team (I include myself in the young part), and experience operations & consulting team (wink-wink pappa Chan) and everything in between, so we thought getting some cross knowledge sharing to see where can we collaborate would be fun, and ideally when we run out of "wor subjects" we can start talking about cool stuff like Will passion for Chinese Caligraphy, or my up and coming Stand Up comedy. But all in due time.

				 To make it easier for you guys, let's do some simple Q & A.<br><br>
          <b> Slides, how many and design? </b><br>
          Good question, Max 10 slides min 4, design and content is not that important, white background and bullet points it's fine, we want to learn from you, not from the slides, just use anything to make it easier on you. <br><br>
          
          <b>I haven't been told what to talk about, what do I do?</b> <br>
          Just ask yourself, WWITAITP, or, What would I talk about it the pub? ;-), other than good old nonsense, the first 15 to 20 minutes of Pub conversation always have an underline "what I do during the week" de-brief, any of the subjects that come out of there would be awesome. <br><br>
          
          <b>What if the team doenst like it?</b> <br>
          I can assure you we are all in aught for all you guys do, such a small team, anything you do we are into!, so talk about your every day, you weekly tasks, a big project coming in, etc.. WE WILL LOVE IT!
          <br><br>
          
          <b>How long should it run for?</b> <br>
10-20 minutes is good! leave time for questions, and quick convos. <br><br>
          
            <b>Help us do better!!!!</b> <br>
I cannot highlight this enough, please let us know how to do better, although we all have different levels of experience we all want to hear from you guys! Our teammates. <br><br>I always want to do better, I am personal, passioned, high energy and always want to do things better, faster, more magnificent!. So your feedback may become our next task. 
<br>So always add what could be improved in your prezo. 
       
                </p>
                <p>
                    I really hope this helps, and if you have any question just let me know, in the coming weeks, I'll be adding content creation and blog writing cheatsheet here and will let you all know about them. 
                </p>
