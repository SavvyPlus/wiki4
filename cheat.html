<h1>Let's do this </h1>

<p>In here, you will find a repository of cheatsheets I've collected through the years to do presentations more engaging and to write better content.
We usually put some constraints in ourself by thinking if is technical doesn't have to be fun, it's quite the opposite, nobody likes to be in a presentation with excellent content and a boring presenter.</p>

Incsub receives over 4 million visits per month and has produced or host millions of blog post around a variety of subject, internally they've created a cheat sheet, and I copied it. Neuli and Cymplar reach were mostly publications on other sites and free resources which are still today being used and replicated by thousands of people. 
              What I've learned : 
One of the most critical skills a founder must have is the capacity to prepare, present and communicate, 9 out of 10 this is by reading and writing, nobody is born with it, it's all practice hard work and sacrifice. Or have Cheatsheet :-), so let's do the second one. </span>

					Let's be honest this knowledge sharing may put ourselves out of our comfort zone, especially when we got to pick the subjects, worst off if we get a topic we don't know a lot about. FEAR not! Because the ultimate purpose of this knowledge sessions is to have fun!, it's true I promise. You see we are kinda a mixed team. Young dev team (I include myself in the young part), and experience operations & consulting team (wink-wink pappa Chan) and everything in between, so we thought getting some cross knowledge sharing to see where can we collaborate would be fun, and ideally when we run out of "wor subjects" we can start talking about cool stuff like Will passion for Chinese Caligraphy, or my up and coming Stand Up comedy. But all in due time.
