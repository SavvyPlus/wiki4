Admin Task : Mark to Market
============================

Created by Kate Daley, last modified on Mar 09, 2016

Two spreadsheets need to be updated every **Monday** (and an additional update to occur on the last day of each month).

Files are found in: S/WPT/Mark to Market

1.  LFH MtM - 20151031 EndOfMonth.xlsx (choose latest date)
2.  MtM Template v8 - 20160208 EndOfMonth MtM (Revised).xlsm (choose latest date)

Steps:

a) Rename each file with new corresponding date

b) Open spreadsheet and update each file with new date that is highlighted in GREEN "As at Date" in Weekly Settlement tab

c) Once date has been entered, the other payment dates will automatically calculate

d) Hit "Get Data" and save file.

That's all !
