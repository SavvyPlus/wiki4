Admin Task : CSR PDF Invoices  
==============================



Once a week, check the folder below for any new CSR Gas and Electricity PDF invoices. These need to be manually entered into a spreadsheet, then the PDF renamed and moved, before sending the spreadsheet to Jarrod for processing.

  

**CHECK FOR INVOICES**

Check the folder for any CSR invoices:

S:\\Consulting\\CSR\\Invoice Validation\\Invoices Received

Open one at a time, ready to be detailed in the below spreadsheet.

  

**FILL OUT SPREADSHEET**

Open this spreadsheet:

S:\\Consulting\\CSR\\Invoice Validation\\Manual PDF Uploads\\Invoice Template

Rename the file with current date and brief description of included invoices (eg. 2016-11-09 Alinta Gas Invoices)

Save

  

Manually enter all components of each invoice into this spreadsheet. Use a previous one to determine each appropriate variable charge and name.

Continue for every invoice.

Once completed, save the file and email to Jarrod.

  

**MOVE & RENAME PDFs**

Once all files have been entered, move the PDFs into this folder to indicate that they have been processed:

S:\\Consulting\\CSR\\Invoice Validation\\PDF Invoices

Save the invoice by finding the corresponding utility, retailer and billing month.

Transfer each PDF to appropriate folder, and then rename the individual files to the following format:

AccNo\_YYYYMM\_1 (or 2 if it is a duplicate) eg. 11110988\_201605\_1.pdf
