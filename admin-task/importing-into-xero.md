Admin Tasks : Importing into Xero
=================================


Once a week, the transactions made with the Billing Card in NAB needs to be manually imported into the Xero account.

Open both Xero and the NAB Connect websites simultaneously and login with appropriate details.

XERO:

1.  Click on SavvyPlus Consulting at the top and click on the heading NAB BILLING CARD
2.  Check the latest transaction date that something has been reconciled on this account. This will be the date that you go from to update the newer transactions from NAB Connect. Also click on the tab "RECONCILE" and look there for the latest date. Go from whichever one is the most recent.

NAB:

1.  Under the NAB Billing Card account, search for the period from the last date to now (ie. if the last amount in Xero was 1 Feb-16, then search all transactions from 1-Feb up until now in NAB) and hit DISPLAY
2.  Click on EXPORT, select SPREADSHEET and select the format as DD-MM-YY and click EXPORT to finalise
3.  This information will download, and needs to be put into a XERO friendly format before it can be imported

On the XERO site under Billing Card, click on MANAGE ACCOUNT → Import a Statement

On the far right of the screen there will be a link for a template to use as the appropriate template "Download our CSV Template"

Use this template to transfer all of the appropriate information across. Ensure that both debited and credited amounts are all under the one column. Leave the PAYEE, REFERENCE and CHEQUE NUMBER columns blank.

Save this file locally as a CSV file.

In Xero, click IMPORT STATEMENT. Browse to find the file and click IMPORT.

These transactions will now appear in the RECONCILE tab under the BILLING CARD, where Jarrod will reconcile them at a later date.
