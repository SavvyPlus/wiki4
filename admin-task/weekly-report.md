Admin Task :  Weekly Report
==================================


**Weekly Report location: S:\\MarketData\\Market Reports\\Weekly**

Every Monday, the following needs to be done to assist with the Weekly Report:

  

1.  Market News

After inserting the news of the day and the weekend, use the "Editor's Choice" filter in the Web Portal to show all of the articles that were a major feature. Compile 10-12 top articles into a Word document with the subject title and short description. Email to Carl.

2. Forward Prices

Open the Weekly Report PBI file found here:

S:\\IT\\Power BI\\Beta version\\Market Data\\Weekly Report.pbix

Update the areas in blue (ie. the date and all of the State's forward prices for Cal and Qtr)
