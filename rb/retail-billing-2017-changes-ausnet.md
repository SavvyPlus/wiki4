Retail Billing : 2017 Changes (Ausnet)
=====================================


**Changes to the 2017 network tariffs include:**

*   the introduction and reassigning of small business customers with annual consumption greater than 40 megawatt hours (MWh) to a new small business tariff from 1 January 2017.
*   AusNet Services notes that since 2002 AusNet Services has classified Small Industrial & Commercial (I&C) customers as those using up to 160MWh and Medium sized customers as those using 160MWh to 400MWh, consistent with National Market definitions. However AusNet Services’ TSS (at Table 3.3) identified Small I & C customers as those using up to 70MWh and Medium I & C customers as those using between 70MWh and 400MWh. To clarify, the TSS was incorrect in stating this, and this Pricing Proposal continues to use the existing classification. This has no impact on customers in those tariff classes.
*   As set out in AusNet Services’ TSS the following changes have been deferred until 2018: a) the introduction of the opt-in residential and small commercial cost-reflective demand tariffs; and b) the introduction of a medium business tariff.

**Demand Definitions**

**Capacity:**

1.  Low Voltage Capacity charge based on the nameplate rating of the transformer supplying the customer’s installation. For sites where the transformer is not dedicated to the customer installation the charge will be established as the portion of the transformer that is allocated to the customer’s requirements.
2.  High Voltage & Sub transmission Capacity based on the rating of the cabling and switchgear that makes the customer connection point.

**Critical Peak Demand Charge**

The demand charge will be based on the average of customer’s maximum kVA recorded on the 5 nominated peak demand weekdays during the Defined Critical Peak Demand Period.

Days must be during the period of December to March, and the days will be nominated and communicated to customers with a minimum of one business days notice. The period during which the demand is to be measured only includes between 2pm-6pm on the nominated day. The 5 maximum’s are averaged and used as the basis for the demand charge for the 12 month period from April to March.
