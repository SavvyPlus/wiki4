### Solar Tariffs

![Solar Tariffs](/uploads/sa-sa-power/solar-tariffs.png "Solar Tariffs")

Time-of-use and Demand definitions
----------------------------------

**Time of Use**

**Energy Consumption**

Code: ENERGY\_M-F\_7-21_PK/OP

**Peak:** Business Days 7.00am - 9.00pm (Central Standard Time)

**Offpeak:** All other times

Type 6 meters typically measure this for week days whereas Type 1-5 meters will measure this in on work days. For Distribution Network Users with Type 6 metering that does not recognize specific days, peak energy is energy consumed on each day between the hours of 0700 and 2100 (Central Standard Time).

Code: DEMAND\_SAPOWER\_BUSINESS

Actual Demand charges for **business** customers are determined on the basis of the maximum half-hour trading interval since the last meter read for:

a. Summer Peak Demand on work days between 1600 and 2100 CDST during November to March only;  
b. Year-round Shoulder Demand on work days between 1200 and 1600 CST or (when operating) CDST);  
c. Off-peak Demand at all other times (the price is zero for actual off-peak demand).

Code: DEMAND\_SAPOWER\_RESIDENTIAL

Actual Demand charges for **residential** customers are determined on the basis of the maximum half-hour trading interval since the last meter read for:  
a. Summer Peak Demand on all days between 1600 and 2100 CDST during November to March only;  
b. Winter Shoulder Demand on all days between 1600 and 2100 CST or (when operating) CDST);  
c. Off-peak Demand at all other times (the price is zero for actual off-peak demand).

Switching tariffs
-----------------

To change Network Tariffs, the Retailer must complete a "Demand Change Request form" and email it to: []()

Requests, if approved, will become effective from the first day of the following month from when the application was received. For example, a request received on 13 January will, if approved, be made effective from 1 February.
