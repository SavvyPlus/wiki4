## Demand

The Maximum demand is measured in kilo volt amps (kVA) and is calculated as the energy consumption recorded over the demand integration period divided by the demand integration period in hours. The demand integration period is 30 minutes. The Maximum Demand for a Supply Point is always more than or equal to the minimum chargeable demand.

Demand Critical Peak

Code: CAPACITY\_SPAUS\_CRITICAL_PEAK

The tariff incentivises large business customers (160 plus megawatt hours per annum) to minimise their electricity consumption or seek alternative supply sources between 2pm and 6pm (AEST) or 3pm to 7pm 'daylight saving time' on five CPD days nominated by AusNet Services between 1st December and 31st March each year.

Switching tariffs
-----------------

AusNet Services requires customers seeking tariff reassignment to remain on the reassigned tariff for a minimum 12-month period. AusNet Services may make exceptions to this requirement at its discretion, where for example, it can be demonstrated that to not do so would result in unreasonable penalties or impose hardship on a customer. This condition prevents customers changing tariffs to take advantage of seasonal variations

Customers requiring an assignment to network tariffs NGT11 or NGT26 must make an explicit request for these tariff assignments. Where a customer makes an election with their retailer to be assigned to either Network Tariff NGT11 or NGT26 AusNet Services will make that assignment effective from the date the request is made by the customer’s retailer. Customers electing to be assigned to tariffs NGT11 or NGT26 may elect to revert to their legacy tariff at any time. The standard form of retailer notice will be the electronic b2b notification.
