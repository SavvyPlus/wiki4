Retail Billing : 2017 Changes (United Energy)
============================================

**Changes to the 2017 network tariffs include:**

**Low voltage small residential customers**

Low voltage small residential customers – UE first introduced a residential demand based tariff in 2015 and in subsequent years has refined the product specification in consultation with stakeholder groups.

Throughout the TSS process UE had indicated a preference to commence transition of customers onto demand tariffs from 2017.

However, the final decision from the AER has determined that transition of customers who consume <40MWh per annum will remain on an “opt-in” basis.

A residential tariff with demand components (RESKW1R) will be available in 2017. It will target 60% of a customer’s DUOS charge to be recovered from demand tariff components. At this level approximately 75% of the calculated LRMC of demand is being recovered from demand tariff components, with the residual revenue being recovered through an anytime energy tariff component. Demand tariff components will be recovered on a $/kW basis.

  

**Low voltage small business customers**

In accordance with UE’s Revised TSS, as endorsed by the AER on the 26th August 2016, eligible customers will transition to a new tariff with a demand component (LVMKW1R) on 1 st January 2017.

This initial step will target 25% of a customer’s DUOS charge to be recovered from demand tariff components with a subsequent step up to 50% (of DUOS from demand) from 2019.

This level approximates the calculated LRMC of demand with the residual revenue being recovered through an anytime energy tariff. Demand tariff components will be recovered on a $/kW basis. LVMKWTOU continues to be available for customers seeking to “opt in” to a fully cost reflective tariff (i.e.50% of DUoS from demand).
