Retail Billing : 2017-18 Changes (Essential Energy)
===================================================

For smaller customers, the time of use energy acts as a reasonable surrogate for the demand, particularly given the majority of small customers have basic metering.

However Essential Energy have introduced optional demand based tariffs for small customers **from 1 July 2017** as meters will progressively change out to interval meters.
