### Common business tariffs

| Tariff Code | Name                            | Eligibility                                                  | Structure & suitability                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TAS22       | Business Low Voltage General    | Any low voltage business customer                            | TAS22 applies a daily supply charge (c/day) and a flat energy charge for all consumption (c/kWh). It is generally economical for low-consuming business customers with consumption less than X or with a high proportion of peak usage. |
| TAS94       | Business Low Voltage ToU        | Any low voltage business customer                            | TAS94 applies a fixed daily charge (c/day) and uses a time of use energy charges for consumption comprising Peak, Shoulder and Offpeak energy rates (c/kWh).Info needed on suitability                                                  |
| TAS82       | Business Low Voltage kVA Demand | For business installations taking low voltage 3-phase supply | TAS82 applies a daily supply charge (c/day), a flat remaining energy rate for consumption and a demand charge (c/kVA/day).Info needed on suitability                                                                                    |

### Feed-In Tariff Scheme

These tariffs have been set by the Tasmanian Economic Regulator and are used in customers with micro embedded generators (ie. solar panels). It requires TasNetworks to reimburse electricity retailers for the difference between the transitional and standard feed-in tariff rates. It applies to the energy 'exported' by commercial installations and 'imported' into the distribution system, where the customer is eligible for the transitional feed-in tariff rate.

TASX1I Residential Low Voltage Import Transitional

TASX21 Business Low Voltage Import Transitional

TASX4I Residential LV Import Fair and Reasonable

TASX5I Business LV Import Fair and Reasonable

TASX6I Non-Qualifying Import

Time-of-use and Demand definitions
----------------------------------

### **Time of Use**

This refers to tariffs that have variable rates depending on the time of day electricity is consumed. These are listed below:



### Business tariffs

**TAS94**

Code: ENERGY\_TASNET\_TAS94_PK/SH/OP

![Tas 94](/uploads/tas-tas-networks/tas-94.png "Tas 94")

**TAS75, TASSDM and TAS15**

Code: ENERGY\_TASNET\_SEASONAL_PK/SH/OP

![Tas 75 Tassdm Tas 15](/uploads/tas-tas-networks/tas-75-tassdm-tas-15.png "Tas 75 Tassdm Tas 15")

  

### Residential tariffs

**TAS92 and TAS93**

Code: ENERGY\_TASNET\_RESI_PK/SH/OP
![Tas 92 Tas 93](/uploads/tas-tas-networks/tas-92-tas-93.png "Tas 92 Tas 93") 


All times used Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST)

**TAS73**

Code: ENERGY\_TASNET\_10HR

Offpeak:

The off-peak rate will be available daily for not less than 10 hours between 20:00 hours and 07:00 hours the following day. In general, the “window” will be of 10 hours duration. Subject to network constraints and at the discretion of Aurora, an 11 hour window may be available upon request.  
To provide a “staggered start” to ensure distribution network stability, the off-peak “window” for individual customers will start between 20:00 and 21:00, and end between 06:00 and 07:00 the following day.

Conjoining tariffs

**TAS61**

For installations connected on this network tariff, energy will be available daily for:  
• at least nine hours between 20:00 hours and 07:00 hours the following day; and  
• a further two hours between 13:00 hours and 16:30 hours.

**TAS63**

Energy to installations connected on this network tariff will only be available between 22:00 hours and 07:00 hours the following day.

### Demand

**For TAS82 &** **TASUMSSL**

Code: DEMAND_MAX15MIN

1.  Maximum Demand

Many of the network tariffs offered by TasNetworks incorporate elements that charge customers for the maximum load (i.e. demand) they take from the distribution network, as opposed to the quantity of electricity they consume over time.

Maximum demand refers to electrical demand measured in kiloVoltAmps (kVA) and is calculated as the energy consumption recorded over the demand integration period divided by the demand integration period in hours. TasNetworks’ demand integration period is 15 minutes.The value is used for setting the maximum demand charges to be paid by the customer during each billing period.

For each billing period, the demand-based charges for an installation on this network tariff is calculated by:  
(a) multiplying the sum of the daily demand-based charges (NUoS) by the number of days in the billing period; and  
(b) multiplying the amount calculated in (a) by the anytime maximum demand recorded during the billing period.

  

**For  TASSDM & TAS15**

Code: DEMAND\_TASNET\_SPECIFIED_DEMAND

2\. Specified Demand

Customers on certain network tariffs are able to agree, or nominate, with TasNetworks a specified demand for their electrical installation. Once agreed, this specified demand is used in the calculation of demand charges for the customer.

Specified demand for all new customers is established as part of the customer connection process and will continue to apply until such time as either the customer requests a change in specified demand or TasNetworks identifies that a change is required.

The monthly demand-based charges (DUoS and TUoS) for an installation on this network tariff are the sum of the daily charges applying to that installation for the month, which are calculated as follows:

• for any day where the daily ATMD is less than or equal to the  
customer’s specified demand, the demand charge for that day will be equal to the customer’s specified demand multiplied by the specified daily demand rate;  
• for any day on which daily ATMD exceeds the customer’s specified demand, but not by more than 20 per cent, then the demand charge for the day will be the ATMD recorded on that day multiplied by the specified demand rate;  
• for any day on which daily ATMD is greater than the customer’s specified demand by more than 20 per cent, the daily demand charge will be:  
• 120 per cent of the customer’s specified demand multiplied by the specified demand rate; plus  
• the difference between the ATMD and 120 per cent of the specified demand, multiplied by the excess demand rate.  
For the purposes of this calculation, the excess demand rate is 10 times the specified demand rate.

Switching tariffs
-----------------

Customers seeking tariff reassignment must:  
(a) be eligible for tariff reassignment; and  
(b) provide TasNetworks with one month’s written notification; and  
(c) pay any applicable tariff alteration

Customers must remain on the reassigned network tariff for a minimum of 12 months. This prevents customers from taking advantage of seasonal variations.

TasNetworks may reassign a customer to another tariff class if the existing customer’s load characteristics or connection characteristics (or both) change such that it is no longer appropriate for that customer to be assigned to their current tariff class. Should a customer no longer have the same or materially similar load or connection characteristics as other customers in the customer‘s existing tariff class, then TasNetworks may also reassign that customer to another tariff class.  
In some cases, a tariff class will cease. TasNetworks’ will notify the customer of this and transition to new tariff classes.
