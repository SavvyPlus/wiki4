Retail Billing : 2016-17 Changes (Ergon)
========================================
**Demand Definition Changes**

The following changes have been made to the **CAC STOUD tariffs** (Connection Asset Customer, Seasonal Time-of-Use Demand):

● The peak demand charge is now based on the customer’s monthly maximum kVA demand during the peak period in each summer month. Previously, this charge was based on the greater of the authorised demand and monthly maximum demand during the peak period.

● The capacity charge is now based on the greater of the customer’s authorised demand and the actual monthly half hour maximum demand. It will apply for all 12 months of the year. Over the summer months, it excludes demand occurring during the peak demand window of 10.00 am to  
8.00 pm on summer weekdays. In 2015–16, this charge was calculated on the greater of a monthly floor and the monthly maximum demand during the non-summer months.

  
The following changes have been made to the **STOUD tariffs** (Residential and Business Seasonal Time-of-Use Demand):

● Amendments have been made to the calculation of the peak and off-peak demand charges.

● The monthly demand charges, for both summer and non-summer, are based on the average demand the customer places on the network in the relevant daily demand window. Previously, the off-peak demand charge was based on the single half-hour maximum demand recorded for the month.

● Further, we will look at the highest four demand days in the month, determined by the average demand recorded in the relevant daily demand window. The monthly demand rate will then be applied to the average of these top four demand days. In 2015–16, the peak demand charge in the summer months was calculated by identifying the four days in the month with the highest single half-hour peak period demand and averaging the half-hourly demand during the peak periods on those days.

**Shoulder Energy Changes**

The following changes have been made to the **STOUE** (Residential and Business Seasonal Time-of-Use Energy) tariffs:

● Consolidated the shoulder energy charge (including time periods) into the peak energy charge.
