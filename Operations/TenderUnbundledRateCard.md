The retailers will be provided with the standard rate card template during the tender request for them to respond with their offers. Upon receiving the retailer's response and rather than entering the offers manually to the Service Agreement template, this template will be able to automatically transform the data and fill up the Service Agreement template

The following are the steps to use the template

- Template location 
	**G:\Shared drives\SavvyPlus\Energy Accounting Operations\Automated Operational Script\Unbundled Rate Card Conversion Template\Template**
- Copy the "**Unbundled Rate Card Conversion Template.v.1.xlsm**", "**Elec Service Agreement.xlsm**", "**Gas Service Agreement.xlsm**" to your Project folder
- Open the template files on your Project folder
- Copy the retailer's offer to "**Elec -unbundled**", "**Elec - Enviro....**", "**Gas - Unbundled**", "**Gas - Veet**"
- Go to "**Data - Elec Rate List**" or "**Data - Gas Rate List**"
- Click on the "**Click to Refresh @@@**" button. The table should refresh with updated data. Otherwise try clicking the button again, if this happen, let me know so that I can fix it
- If the data is fine, open (if not yet) the Service Agreement template (Elec or Gas)
- Then click on the "**Copy to Template >>>>**"
- Watch the magic happens

**Additional Note**
- The Rate Card table's header has the option to change the rate type as per retailer's offer. For instance, the SME offer for Electricity is usually in c/kWh while the Large can be in $/MWh. So, select the rate type according and the conversion will take place automatically.
- In order to change the rate type on the header, you'll need to "Unprotect" the sheet
