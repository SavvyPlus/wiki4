# We use tabula... 

If you’ve ever tried to do anything with data provided to you in PDFs, you know how painful this is — you can’t easily copy-and-paste rows of data out of PDF files. Tabula allows you to extract that data in CSV format, through a simple web interface.

Caveat: Tabula only works on text-based PDFs, not scanned documents. If you can click-and-drag to select text in your table in a PDF viewer (even if the output is disorganized trash), then your PDF is text-based and Tabula should work.


## Where to find it ?

http://pdf2csv.zawee.work 
Inside the portal there is enougn documentation on how to use , and questions you may have , a little bit of playing around wil shortly show you the benefits and downfalls, we havent devleoped or particpated in the creation of this porject. 

We wont be doing any fancy spancy stuff to it , so use it as is , is on a small server so if you feel lile uplading 200MB of pdf in one go , we can only wish best luck in your endeveours :-)

**NOTE** 
Is a good Idea that you download any temaplets you've created and keep them in a share folder in GDRIVE , because if the servers goes down your templates will be lost 


Also if you need to change loads of CSV and want to do it faster and more effciently that excel we recomend open Rafine , super easy to use and install http://openrefine.org/download.html
