# The basics
So to begin with, we are Zawee, a bunch of people looking to use tech to change the world.  Ok that could be an overstatement, but we are passionate about tech and want to develop tools to improve business processes, model data and develop cool stuff.

## Company confusion

You may hear a few company names floating around.  So this is how it works...
- Zawee - this is the company most of us are employed under, its the parent company
- Empower Analytics - this is a tiny company we setup for any modelling work
- SavvyBI - this company owns all the data management and business intelligent tools for presenting data to our clients.
- SavvyPlus - this was the original consulting company, still operating and where most of the consulting work sits under.

## The basic tech

Now you're part of the Zawee team, you'll need a few things to get going.  We host all of our infrastructure in AWS.  Don't know what AWS is, its Amazon on sterioids for the tech world.

To get connected to our network which we've built from the ground up, you'll either be granted one of these two options;
**- Option A - BYO laptop with a VPN**
**- Option B - A iMac or Windows PC**

Either way you'll be given a Windows credentials where most services and apps authenticate against.

**When you join Zawee, we use these tools**
- Active Directory - the master authenticator for your logins
- AWS - where our infrastructure is built
- Gsuite - for email and Google Drive for file storage
- Slack - for all internal communications
- Asana - project management for all your tasks
- Github - store your code here
- Facebook Workplace - for weekly feedback
